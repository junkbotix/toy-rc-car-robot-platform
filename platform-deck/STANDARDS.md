### Inches to Metric

| Fractional | Decimal | Metric (mm) | Notes
| :--------: | :-----: | :---------: | :---------------------------
|     1.0    | 1.00000 |   25.40000  | oc hole spacing for pegboard
|     1/2    | 0.50000 |   12.70000  | oc hole spacing for Meccano
|     1/4    | 0.25000 |    6.35000  | type "B" pegboard hd
|    3/16    | 0.18750 |    4.76250  | type "A" pegboard hd (loose fit for Meccano)
| (others useful for grid layout calculations)
|     n/a    | 0.16142 |    4.10000  | Meccano standard hd
|     1/8    | 0.12500 |    3.17500  | one-half type "B" pegboard hd
|    3/32    | 0.09375 |    2.38125  | one-half type "A" pegboard hd

### Carbon Steel (Gauge to Decimal Inches / Millimeters)

| Gauge | Decimal | Metric (mm) | Notes
| :---: | :-----: | :---------: | :---------------------------------------------
|   18  | 0.0478  |    1.214    | Heavy duty, may be difficult to fabricate with?
|   20  | 0.0359  |    0.911    | Best compromise between thickness vs strength?
|   22  | 0.0299  |    0.759    | Light duty, probably ok for brackets?
|   24  | 0.0239  |    0.607    | "

### Aluminium (Gauge to Decimal Inches / Millimeters)

| Gauge | Decimal | Metric (mm) | Notes
| :---: | :-----: | :---------: | :---------------------------------------------
|   18  | 0.04030 |    1.024    | Probably the best for fabrication...
|   20  | 0.03196 |    0.812    | Light duty, probably ok for brackets?

## Pegboard (perforated hardboard)
---

<br>

### Standard (compatible with Meccano, see below)

* A (1/8") - 1" oc, 3/16" hd
* B (1/4") - 1" oc, 1/4" hd

### Metric

* 22.0mm oc, 4.0mm hd
* 25.0mm oc, 6.0mm hd (marginally compatible with Lego Technic, see below)

## Meccano Standard (other steel construction toys may or may not conform)
---

<br>

### Girders / Plates

* Width / Length = (number_of_holes * 0.5)"
* Perforated strips are 0.041" thick
* Flat and angle girders are 0.033" thick
* Larger flat plates are 0.026" thick, and about .001" of that is paint
* Flat plates made by Exacto are .043" thick
* Hole spacing compatible with Standard (A & B) inch hole-spaced pegboard

### Screws / Bolts

* 5/32" thread (close to M4)

### Axle Rod Diameter

* 0.160" / 4.04mm

### Standard (compatible with Standard pegboard, but not Lego Technic)

* Original - 1/2" oc, 4.1mm / 0.161417" hd
* Modern - 1/4" oc, 4.1mm / 0.161417" hd

No fractional inch hole diameter for Meccano exists, but a close-fit would be 331/2048 (0.16162)". A hole diameter of 3/16" (0.1875") will be a loose fit, but good enough for most mounting needs (and standard for type "A" pegboard).

### Metric (not compatible with Meccano or Lego Technic)

* Original - 12.7mm oc, 4.1mm hd
* Modern - 6.3mm oc, 4.1mm hd

## Lego Technic
---

<br>

* 8.0mm oc, 4.8mm hd (marginally compatible with 25.0mm oc metric pegboard, see note below)

For drilling the holes, use a 4.8mm (0.18897 inches, #12) drill bit. A 5mm drill bit can also be used, but the hole will be loose. A 3/16 (0.1875) inch drill bit might work ok, too, in wood or plastic (the hole might be a bit tight).

### Compatibility

Lego Technic is "marginally compatible" with 25.0mm oc, 6.0mm hd pegboard. Because every three holes in Lego Technic are spaced 24mm apart, use of bolts or other means to secure it to the pegboard can be used.
