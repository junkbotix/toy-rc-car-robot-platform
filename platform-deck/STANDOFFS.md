# Standoffs

Usually when you build a deck plate for your robot and chassis, you will find you need one or more "standoffs" to support the deck. Often, these standoffs will be of different lengths, or may need some other custom property. 

## Threaded Rod or Long "all-thread" Bolts

Thin threaded rod (or long bolts) can be a quick and easy (if not pretty) standoff substitute. Just secure the body of the bolt to the chassis with a nut or two, then do the same with the deck plate. This method also has the advantage of making different length standoffs easy to implement (just change the spacing of the nuts or length of the bolts as needed).

## Rigid Plastic Tubing

Rigid plastic tubing can be purchased, but it can be cheaper to use something usually on hand, and many times found as garbage, in the form of...disposable ink pens! Just remove the insides, and you're left with a convenient tube to use as a standoff (and/or cut to size - use of a plastic tubing cutter is recommended).

You can use these as a "spacer" when doing the "long bolt" / "all-thread" method above (instead of using additional nuts), or you can affix "end-capping" to the tubes. One method would be to take a hot glue gun, and "blop" some glue in each end. Then use machine screws to screw into the glue once it has cooled.

Alternatively, you could coat the screw with some petroleum jelly, and before the glue sets, put the screw in it. Once set, unscrew the screw, leaving behind "molded" threads.

Another option would be to glue a solid plug of wood or plastic into the ends of the tube, then drill-n-tap that for your fasteners.

## Rigid Metal Tubing

Metal tubing typically has to be purchased, but you may be able to find it by other means. Regardless, choose aluminium or thin-wall brass or copper if possible, for the lightest weight. Utilizing such tubing can be done in the same manner as rigid plastic tubing, above.

## Wood Doweling

Cut and center drill some wood dowels, and you have some simple and fairly light weight standoffs. Such doweling comes in a variety of wood types, but the cheapest is "white pine" or similar.

## Coat Hangers

Wire coat hangers can be cut and bent in such a fashion to make usuable standoff-like risers. You can also thread thick hanger wire with a proper die to make cheap "all-thread". Plastic coat hangers are usually of hollow tubing. Both types can be cut and used as directed above for rigid tubing.

## Hot Glue Sticks

In a pinch, hot glue sticks can be used as an effective material for standoffs. Cut to the lengths needed, and either secure with more hot glue (not strong, but doable), or drive screws into the ends to secure to the chassis and deck plate.

## Straws

Plastic or paper straws can all be used as cheap and effective standoffs. They won't support a lot of weight, nor can they be made "tall" without bending too much (although it might be possible to remedy this in some manner). You can also find thick plastic reusable straws fairly cheaply.

Stainless steel straws can also be used, but use caution after cutting, due to possible sharp edges. A tubing cutter is the best tool to use for this.

## Do you have any suggestions?

I'm interested in hearing about them! Let me know (or issue a PR), so I can add them to this list...thanks!
