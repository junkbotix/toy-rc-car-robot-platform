# Notes on Additional Tools

In some of my videos I may use a few tools that aren't strictly necessary for this tutorial, but I have found them useful to me, both for this project and in general. So I wanted to share them with you, and why I like them.

### Head-mounted Magnifier

https://www.amazon.com/Beileshi-Magnifier-Professional-Interchangeable-Magnifying/dp/B00KAU5FSC/

I use something like this one because I like the integrated and positionable LED lighting, and the variety of lenses (of different magnification levels) it comes with. I found that it doesn't obscure my vision much when I want to "look under" it (ie, no magnification). That said, it doesn't work well with my glasses, other options might be a better.

### IR Thermometer (Temperature Probe)

The one I have I actually purchased at Harbor Freight, but this one is very similar. I honestly don't know how accurate it is, but I use it more for "is it too hot to touch" and "is the temperature changing" - especially in places where access may not be easy, or is potentially dangerous.

#### NOTE: These kinds of "non-contact" probes are not meant to be able to measure human temperature levels. DO NOT use them to attempt to check for fever or anything like that. They are NOT designed for such usages, and may give misleading or WRONG results.
