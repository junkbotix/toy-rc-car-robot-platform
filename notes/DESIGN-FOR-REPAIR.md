# Design for Repair or Manufacture?

In one of my videos, you can note that I struggled a bit with removing the front steering actuator, and had to abandon the effort, at least for now. I did so because continuing on wouldn't yield me more information about the steering, and could potentially lead me to breaking the components involved. So I decided to leave it, unless later I'm unable to figure out, using other tools, what the wires going to the actuator are all for (I know at least two control the motor in it - but the other two are a bit of a mystery right now).

I didn't want to force things, or potentially break things, and while I could have potentially taken things apart enough to get to the actuator, it would have resulted in a complex process that would have involved removing multiple assemblies, and keeping track of screws and more in order to successfully re-assemble everything later. Right now, all of that may not be necessary.

In manufacturing, there's concepts relating around "designing for repair" versus "designing for manufacture". Each have their tradeoffs. In the first, the tradeoff is that the design made need to be more complex to support the ability to repair or replace parts. Special tools might be needed, or more complex procedures done to perform the repair. This is one of the reason hobby-grade RC vehicles are more expensive. It also explains why some other household items are more expensive - if things are easy to repair, that design may also mean they are more difficult to manufacture as well. A manufacturer will try to balance this, but in general something that is easy to repair likely costs more to make, so it will be sold at a higher price (things are more complex than this from the businesses perspective, though).

"Design for Manufacturing" (DFM) turns this on it's head - basically, things that are easy to manufacture, tend to be cheaper (and quicker) to make, and also sell. Both the consumer and the manufacturer (and every "middle-man" along the way) benefits - with one exception: 

Usually, such items are difficult, maybe impossible (or nearly so for most people) to repair. 

That is usually due to complex assembly procedures (that make a device virtually impossible to disassemble once assembled), or special fasteners (that may make it easier to manufacture, but are difficult to remove because they are special in some manner), or other (increasingly) use of custom software that defines features or such that, if the software breaks, or things need to be substituted that the software isn't designed for, means the software needs to be changed, which usually isn't allowed, but even if it is, requires special tools and knowledge most people don't have.

In the case of toy-grade RC vehicles, it usually just means things will be more difficult to disassemble, and you either have to get creative (making or improvising tools or techniques to allow you to do so), or you may have to use more "brute force" (and understand that you may break things to the point where the vehicle won't work any longer for your needs).
