# Electric vs Nitro-Power RC

All toy-grade RC cars are powered by electric motors, usually small and low-cost brushed DC motors, ranging in voltage from about 3 volts, up to 12 volts or so - most that I have found have been in the range of 7.2 to 9.6 volts, and use mostly Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery packs.

Some hobby RC vehicles, particularly older ones, used small "nitro" engines which ran off specially mixed fuel in order to have longer run times than batteries could supply the DC motors (and motor controllers) that were common. Only fairly recently has that changed, with the advent of lithium chemistry batteries, and today brushless DC (BLDC) motors. Such batteries can deliver more current for longer times, and the motors have more power and are more efficient than brushed motors.

Nitro-engine vehicles are still popular and sold, but they tend to be more mechanically complex (drivetrain), and more expensive to purchase, maintain and fuel. They also can overall be dirtier, as the fuel has a fair amount of oil in it, which can collect a lot of dirt (especially when used on dirt, which a previous owner did with my T-Maxx). These and other reasons have led to electrics become much more popular over time.

# Shocks vs Springs

Hobby grade RC cars typically use actual oil-filled (hydraulic) shocks, in addition to springs (which can be purchased with varying stiffness, depending on driving and suspension needs). Most are so-called "coil-overs" (where the spring is mounted over and around the shock) - but you do see independent spring systems on occasion. The shocks can be repaired, rebuilt, and refilled as needed with new oil.

Toy-grade TC cars, though, typically only have springs with a simulated "shock". Some of the "toy" vehicles of better quality will sometimes have friction or pneumatic-style dampening, as a part of the "shock", or as part of the suspension linkage, but most toy-grade RC cars don't.

# Half-shaft "Dogbones"

Most toy-grade RC vehicles have "straight axles" in the rear, much like many actual rear-wheel drive pickups. Most of the time they don't have a differential.

Independent suspensions, if they are used, are typically only used on the front un-driven wheels. Most toy-grade RC cars are two-wheel, rear-drive vehicles - unlike most actual cars sold, with the exception of most pickup trucks.

Hobby-grade RC vehicles, though (and a few rare toy RC vehicles) typically use fully independent suspension systems, and to support such a system, you need a way to get power to the wheels that can "flex" with the suspension. The suspension arm system on these vehicles travel in such a way that the shaft may also need to shorten or lengthen as the suspension moves.

In hobby-grade RC vehicles, this is typically done using either small universal joints, or with heavy-duty "dogbone" joints (which are typically all metal - unlike the vehicle I am using, which is metal and plastic). The joints also sometimes have rubber "boots" to protect them from dust and dirt (much like real automobiles). To support the changing length of the shafts (mainly those using universal joints), the shafts can be in two parts, with linear splines to allow a sliding motion while the shaft is turning.

In toy-grade RC vehicles that have such a suspension, most will use plastic components, and "dogbone" half-shafts are prefered over universal joints (fewer moving components).

On both, if dogbones are used, the "cups" the ends of the dogbones fit into will have grooves that the pins can ride in, which also allows for the changing length of the shaft as the suspension moves.
