# Notes on Tools

The toolkit I show in some of my YouTube videos isn't available any longer, at least I couldn't locate something like it on Amazon. 

When I originally bought it years ago, it was sold to repair and build personal computers, which is more of niche hobby today. So most of the tool kits out there are meant for laptop and cell phone repair. They don't typically include some of the larger tools needed. So what I'm going to link below is what you might purchase today in order to build out the robot platform described in this tutorial series.

Soldering Toolkit - https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Iron-Kit-Temperature-Screwdrivers/dp/B07GJNKQ8W/

This toolkit has many of the basics for soldering, but isn't complete. It does have wire cutters, tweezers and a small-bit 8-in-one multi-tip screwdriver. The soldering iron also looks good to start out with (certainly better than my first soldering iron). 

Supplement it with a low-cost multimeter (you'll need one later):

...and some pliers:

A larger screwdriver may or may not be needed, the screwdriver included in the kit above might be enough for most small toy RC vehicles. But just in case, here's a low-cost option that is similar to the one in the video:

Remember, for cheap toy RC cars (and for that matter, hobby RC cars as well), use tools that are properly sized, especially when tightening screws going into soft plastic (like most toy RC cars are made from), or even aluminum (like you'll encounter on hobby-grade RC cars). Larger tools prevent you from feeling how much torque you are using, and can easily cause you to strip the screw or the screw hole. So try a smaller tool first, before moving to larger ones.

In the case of screwdrivers, use the proper sized bit for the head of the screw - if the bit doesn't fit, or it feels like it is "slipping" out of the head, it can strip the head, making it difficult to remove or replace. Try using a smaller (or larger) bit as needed. Also, if a screw does strip - or it has a damaged head - try to replace it with a new one. I like to keep a large collection of screws (and bolts and nuts) from everything I take apart. It has saved my bacon more times than I can mention.

Something I didn't use (I don't even own one) was an RC car repair stand. Such a stand can be useful to keep your car from rolling around on your workbench or table as you work on it (and later, as you test it), but one isn't strictly necessary. 

Purchasing one can range from cheap to very expensive. You can improvise something with stack of books, or use a cheap brick or two, with some felt or rubber glued on, they can work work just as well.
