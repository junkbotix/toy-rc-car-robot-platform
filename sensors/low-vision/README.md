# Low Vision Sensors

Low vision sensors generally fall under the category of "computer" or "machine" vision - albeit as a very myopic form.

Such sensors differ from a simple light sensor in that they usually incorporate multiple light sensor elements (but far fewer than a digital camera would use), and sometimes also use focusing or other elements to aid in shape and direction recognition tasks. Below are a few examples I have found on the internet regarding this fascinating and under-appreciated form of robotic sensing.
