# Drive Motor H-Bridge Relays

[HRW-1 Datasheet](./HRW-1xxx-RCElectronics.pdf)

These are basic SPDT power relays with high-amperage contacts (10A @ 28VDC). They are driven by a couple of the transistors to the left of the above image (I haven't identified which, yet).

These relays, according to the datasheet, have a "vented plastic case", a 9 volt DC coil (40 mA, 225 ohms), and "silver alloy" contacts (L-1 Form C).

No idea what "silver alloy" is used, but all of them seem meant for preventing welding of the contacts under high-current loads (such as the motor in my toy RC vehicle):
