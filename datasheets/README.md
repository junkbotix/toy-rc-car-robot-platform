# Datasheets and Parts Identification

## Useful Tools for Identifying and Testing Parts

Using a digital camera (or phone camera) in macro mode can be helpful, but sometimes it's just not possible to get at the right angle or close enough to really see the values. In those cases, the following tools can help.

A head-mount magnifier:

...or a jewelers loupe, or in a pinch, a magnifying glass.

Also - if you have parts that you need to identify characteristics or values of, or that they are working, another good tool to have is:

Note that similar testers and instructions on how to build them can be found on the internet, too. It is also possible to use an oscilloscope and/or a multimeter to find out these values, using the right accessories (that's all the above tool is doing), but it isn't as quick or easy.

## Some other things to note when searching for datasheets

During my searching for datasheets (not just the ones here), I have noticed a variety of things which I want to point out, which may help you along in your searching:

* Verify and match the part numbers exactly
* Match the part case type (ie, TO-92 to SOT-23)
* Use multiple manufacturer's datasheets to compare
* Compare the part's parameters between datasheets for same part

Some other things to keep in mind:

* Parts with different case types likely have different parameters and characteristics!
* Even when the part number and case type match, parts can be different!
* Complementary part values (eg, transistors) may not be accurately specified!
* Compare, compare, compare - then compare some more!

Please keep the above list in mind when you search for datasheets yourself, as it can be real tricky at times. When in doubt, use multiple sources and stick with the one that either matches the number exactly, or has common values for the part parameters.
